##### ThemeSamples package for Office UI Fabric React

This is not a production ready package and __should never be used in product__. This ThemeSamples space is useful for serving as an example for theme definition and for testing new themes before finalizing them for use elsewhere.

To import ThemeSamples themes:

```js
import { ThemeName } from '@uifabric/theme-samples';
```
