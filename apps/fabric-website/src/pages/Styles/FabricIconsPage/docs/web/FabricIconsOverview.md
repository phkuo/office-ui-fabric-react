Fabric uses a custom font for its iconography. This font contains glyphs that you can scale, color, and style in any way. You can even flip them for right-to-left localization. You can also download and install the icon font to use it with various design apps like Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD.

**The icons on this page refer to the general-use monoline icons. See the [brand icons page](#/styles/web/office-brand-icons) for multi-color product and document icons.**
